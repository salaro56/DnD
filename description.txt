[i/s1:75] [c/51DA5F:What is DnD Terraria?]
Dungeons and Dragons Terraria is an unofficial D&D inspired mod that is a faithful recreation of DnD into the world of Terraria.
While the mod may not be the most powerful or in depth mod out there it adds a sense of familiarity from an all time favourite game of mine.
To get started all you need is level 1, a book, and a mana crystal!

[i/s1:75] [c/51DA5F:What does this mod add to the game?]
[c/51DA5F:●] Many New Spells
[c/51DA5F:●] Leveling System
[c/51DA5F:●] Spellslot System
[c/51DA5F:●] Class System

[i/s1:75] [c/51DA5F:Damage System]
[c/51DA5F:●] This mod uses a unique damage system that's accurate to the rolled dice from DnD.
[c/51DA5F:●] For balancing reasons we chose to also multiply spells by a proficiency bonus that increases as you level up to make the spells better as the game progresses
[c/51DA5F:●] Due to their unique nature and possibility of doing low damage all weapons are capable of ignoring defense

[i/s1:75] [c/51DA5F:Planned Updates]
[c/51DA5F:●] Bosses and Monsters from DnD
[c/51DA5F:●] More Spells
[c/51DA5F:●] More Weapons using DnD's damage system
[c/51DA5F:●] Familiar DnD Items

[i/s1:75] [c/51DA5F:Getting Started!]
[c/51DA5F:●] All you need to get started is a mana crystal to make the PHB and craft your spells

[c/51DA5F:●] Massive thanks to Jeo for the item artwork! Amazing work was done and I couldn't be more thankful
